            What if phones were too much?
            More like, what if I gave a fuck
            It's just slow death by a thousand cuts
            Tech or not, this shit fucking sucked
            Rolling start on the race to the bottom
            No brakes, windshield or credit, no problem
            Make an offer to the econ goblin
            Print more money so the line stops wobbling down
            Drink to postpone foul fortune
            Twisted like ball-sack torsion
            Just got barely enough for a 40 and a Whopper post-landlord extortion
            No wage, just pay
            One more day, depression on the way
            It's not hit yet, I'm just in pain
            More brain cells die every day

            Reverse
            Lawnmower
            Reverse
            Lawnmower man

            Everyday
            My faculties just fray
            Can't explain
            Down the fucking drain
            Every day
            Even less remain
            Can't explain
            Live in order profane
            Every day
            Wander as if Cain
            Can't explain
            Alien terrain
            Every day
            The cerebral strain
            Noise of blades in my head, ingrained

            Try to eat the Silica packet
            At bottom of the beef jerky bag in my jacket
            The world's crumbled and so am I
            Get high, get by, I try
            To not die, it works on occasion
            Unsure when it does, no confirmation
            Research, catalog card found, pulled it
            Apocalypse, fuck the Mad Max bullshit
            Feeling like the frog in biology
            Given a rock band, mic tracheostomy
            I spit it like ribbit 'til I croak
            Livin' in shit, still smelling like a rose
            That somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed
            Everything I say has already been said
            Everything I say has already been spat
            One large Farva to go make it fast
            In a rush to kill all eye floaters
            Enough hallucinations, sans those interlopers
            Plus, boomer shit, old people odors
            Congress smells like moth balls and foreclosures
            Hope they run out of bones and fall apart
            Descarte, brain fart, restart
            The guillotine runs on Diesel now
            Hit the primer, rip the chord, feed the suits to the mouth

            Reverse
            Lawnmower
            Reverse
            Lawnmower man
            Reverse
            Lawnmower
            Reverse
            Lawnmower man

            Every day
            Wander as if Cain
            Can't explain
            Alien terrain
            Every day
            The cerebral strain
            Noise of blades
            In my head, ingrained
            Every day
            Can't explain
            Noise of blades
            In my head
            Ingrained!
